# Streetlight
The Intelligent Streetlight Network uses IoT sensors (LDR, ACS712, temperature) with an ESP8266 to monitor streetlight performance. A Decision Tree algorithm predicts faults for timely maintenance. A public complaint portal and admin dashboard ensure quick response, reduce energy use, and enhance urban safety and reliability.
